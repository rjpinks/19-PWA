# PWA Walkthrough

## Description

I studied this app because the principals it showed could be useful when developing sites that are accessible to people with unstable internet connection. It can be used by people who want to use a web based text editor, but they also need access to it while offline.

## Installation

express, in-env, code-mirror-themes, idb, and webpack are all necessary to run this app. Ensure that you run seed and run build, and there is multiple packages.

## Usage

Use it as a text editor. You can also click the install button to have access to the program when internet conditions are unstable
